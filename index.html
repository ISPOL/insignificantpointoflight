	<div id=AboutDesc>Hi! I'm Alan, a 22 year old computer science grad from the University of Connecticut. I am currently looking for a job! My current interests are web development, game design, and music in amateur compositions and piano covers. You can check out some of my stuff in the other tabs by clicking on the top! The Projects Tab has a brief summary of the other tabs, while the others all go to the projects directly. </div>

		<h3>Board</h3>
		One of the first projects I do when learning a new programming language is to make a basic square with it. After that is accomplished, it can be expanded upon as I pick up more things. This is an iteration of my HTML/CSS/Javascript(JQuery) boards; the other versions of the board (mostly experiments with the youtube iframe API) can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/ISPOL/OldHTML-CSSBoardStuff">Github</a>. The version in the 'Board' section of this website was created for <a href="http://elementscommunity.org/forum/forum-brawl/forum-forum-brawl-6-round-5/">Brawl,</a> a team based creative arts competition in the ElementsTheGame community. 

		The Goal: Find the treasure in as few moves as possible while avoiding the suspicion of the dragon!

		<h3>Music</h3>
		Music has always been a big part of my life; I took formal piano lessons as a kid, but they never really stuck and I wasn't able to muster the interest to complete them. Fortunately, there are other ways to enjoy music, whether it's exploring random things on piano or composing through MuseScore.

			<p>Mountains of rubble and gold fly through the countryside. Aurdinas has fallen! Now the dragon rests, sleeping off the indigestion that the corpulent denizens of the golden city gave to the drake as their final parting gift. Many nations have marshalled their forces to slay the dragon and seize the riches of Aurdinas for themselves. You figure you have enough time to sneak in and nab a few treasures for yourself before they get there, if you're quick enough. You just need to make sure not to wake the dragon! </p>
			<p>
				Press any key to start. Arrow keys or WSAD to move.	Press space to rest. Press TAB to end the game. Press any key to bring back this screen. A blue glow means safety. A red glow indicates danger, and you should lay low until it passes. Gain score for the treasures you find, lose score each time you take a rest. Good luck!</p>
