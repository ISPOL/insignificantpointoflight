		<div id=AboutDesc>Hi! I'm Alan, a 22 year old computer science grad from the University of Connecticut. I am currently looking for a job! My current interests are web development, game design, and music in amateur compositions and piano covers. You can check out some of my stuff in the other tabs by clicking on the top! The Projects Tab has a brief summary of the other tabs, while the others all go to the projects directly. </div>

		<div id=MusicDesc>Music has always been a big part of my life; I took formal piano lessons as a kid, but they never really stuck and I wasn't able to muster the interest to complete them. Fortunately, there are other ways to enjoy music, whether it's exploring random things on piano or composing through MuseScore. Below are some of the things I've uploaded to soundcloud! </div>
